Vim 7.3 comes with a new feature called "conceal."
One application of it is dynamically displaying unicode glyph of a given combination of patterns or keywords.
For instance, we can display unicode right arrow  â†’  on the screen with ascii right arrow in the buffer.
There has been vim coneal syntax files for differenc programming langauges, like

* [haskell](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Haskell-Conceal)
* [perl](https://github.com/c9s/perl-conceal.vim)
* [ruby](http://ithaca.arpinum.org/2010/11/06/vim-conceal-for-ruby.html)
* [latex](http://b4winckler.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/using-the-conceal-vim-feature-with-latex/)]
